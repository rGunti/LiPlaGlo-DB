  "description_de": "Vehicle registration plates (German: Kraftfahrzeug-Kennzeichen or, more colloquially, Nummernschilder) are mandatory alphanumeric plates used to display the registration mark of a vehicle registered in Germany. A significant feature of German vehicle registration plates is the area code, which can be used to tell the district of registration. It has developed into a widespread habit in Germany, even a children's game when travelling, to guess \"where that vehicle is from\".\n\nSource: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vehicle_registration_plates_of_Germany",
  "vanity_plates_description_de": "For an extra charge of €10.20, vehicle owners can register a personalised identifier, keeping to the above rules. In most cases of personalised plates, owners choose their initials and a number reflecting their date of birth. In this fashion, fictional Mrs Ulrike Mustermann, born 2 May 1965 and living in Essen, might choose E-UM 2565 for her car. By combining area code and random letters, further possibilities arise, such as a man from Oldenburg named Olaf, born on Christmas Eve, could choose OL-AF 2412. A resident of the town of Pirna might choose PIR-AT 77, Pirat meaning \"pirate\" in German. Kiel and Kleve are two examples of places where the number plate can spell out all of the city name.\n\nSource: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vehicle_registration_plates_of_Germany#Personalised_plates"
